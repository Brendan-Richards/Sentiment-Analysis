This project is an attempt to perform sentiment analysis on a data set consisting of a large number of text documents. These text documents are amazon reviews for various products which are labeled with an integer score in the range [1, 5] with 5 being the most positive and 1 being the most negative. The goal was to create a model that can process the text data of a review and correctly predict if it is negative, neutral, or positive. For this purpose scores 1 and 2 are considered negative, 3 is considered neutral, and 4 and 5 are considered positive.
